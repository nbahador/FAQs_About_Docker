## How do Docker, images, containers, and Dockerfiles interact?

> **Docker is a tool that helps in creating, deploying, and running applications using containers. Here's a breakdown of the key concepts:**

> - **Images**: Templates for containers. They describe what should be inside a container, including the OS, software, and settings.
> - **Containers**: Isolated environments where your app runs. They are like mini-computers with everything your app needs to work, but they are lightweight and take up little space.
> - **Dockerfile**: A text file with instructions for building an image. It tells Docker what software to install, how to set up the environment, and how to run the app inside the container.

## What does standardized environments mean?

> **Standardized environments simply mean creating a consistent setup for running applications.** 
> 
> If you develop an app on your computer, you want it to work the same way when it's run on someone else's computer. By using standardized environments, you ensure that everything is the same everywhere.
